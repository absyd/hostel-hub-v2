## Project Description

**Hostel & Meal Management System**

The Hostel & Meal Management System is a role-based web application designed to digitally manage hostel residents, meal tracking, and rental payments in an organized and transparent way. The system eliminates manual record keeping by centralizing user management, meal calculation, and financial tracking into a single platform.

This application supports four different user roles — **Admin, Manager, Meal Manager, and Resident (User)** — each with controlled access based on responsibilities. The Admin has full authority over the system, while Managers handle resident registration and rental operations. Meal Managers maintain daily meal records and meal cost calculations, and residents can securely view their personal expenses, payments, and balances.

Users cannot create accounts independently; instead, authorized personnel register residents and provide login credentials, ensuring controlled access and data integrity.

The system automatically calculates monthly expenses by combining meal consumption and hostel rent, allowing residents and management to clearly monitor payments, dues, and financial summaries. Role-based dashboards provide relevant insights and operational efficiency for each type of user.

By digitizing hostel operations, the platform improves transparency, reduces calculation errors, and simplifies daily administrative tasks.
